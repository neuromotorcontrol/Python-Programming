def fibonnaci(num):
    """
    Given an integer value num, returns a list containing the first n 
    numbers in the fibonacci sequence. The fibonacci sequence is a 
    sequence of numbers where the i-th number F_i is defined as follows:

    For i = 0,        F_i = 0 
    For i = 1,        F_i = 1 
    For all other i,  F_i = F_(i-1) + F_(i-2)

    For example, fibonacci(7) should return the following list:
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
    
    If the input n < 0, returns an empty list.
